A Clone Hero Patterns Generator which is (will be) able to generate notes.chart files with certain patterns for YARG/Clone Hero.

Building:
- cmake is required
- I am using gcc (I think?) so if other c/c++ compilers complain that's probably why
- run build.sh to build the program

TODOs:
- almost everything

<sub>(Note that I am not experienced with C++, there might and will be bad code)</sub>
